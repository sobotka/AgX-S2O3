# Hello, Wanderer

You seem to have wandered well off of your path. Since you are lost, I leave
the following breadcrumbs to help you find your way back...

# Why

It seems the ideas in this archive have spread to places the author would
never have guessed. A small document to help those who have tried to parse
the scripts felt in order.

# Curves are Meaningless

Generally speaking, the nature of the structure of some random curve
is completely inconsequential in terms of an *affecting* force. Because
the techniques included herein are entirely *effective*, we can expect
no such correspondence beyond broad and hand wavy things. Always remember
that we are adjusting normalized stimuli wattages when adjusting RGB, and
as such, it's all mumbo jumbo janky in terms of what we are trying to control.
No amount of misleading knobs, pulleys, widgets, wheels, and other ephermera,
no matter how much an author professes with language, will *affect* the
cognized elements. The metrics of all curves are normalized RGB wattages,
and as such, the curve formula employed herein is detached from the more
important mechanisms present in this archive.

Curves manipulate metrics, and the metrics are detached from the desired
meaning territory in the RGB stimuli sense. **Do not become obsessed with
formulas for curves. They do not matter in the least, and they do not control
what people think they control.**

The original sigmoidal curve within this repository was originally authored by
Jed Smith. It can be swapped out with anything that patterns a general
sigmoidal response in theory.

# Rotations, Insets, and Outsets

The key part of the mechanisms in this mausoleum can be distilled down to
two crucial parts:
* Additive stimuli
* Rotation and control over the coordinates

The effort within this vault was an experiment to address *cognitive* issues
with pictorial depictions, and [the way we use algorithms to form those
pictorial depictions](https://github.com/sobotka/scise/wiki/Picture-Formation).

## Additive Stimuli

By using a simplistic matrix approach, we can add additive energy to the opponent stimuli. This relates to our segmentation-decomposition cogntive mechanisms, and formulates a cognitive "grammar" when a channel by channel
lookup formula is employed.

## Rotation and Control of the Basis Vectors

Permitting an author to control the basis coordinates is key for authorship.
Our cognitive machinations that yield segmentation-decomposition are unknown,
and our models are extremely impoverished. As such, it is absolutely imperative
that the picture formation approach allows an author to control the nature of
the formation for their specific pictorial needs. At the same time, ergonomics
are crucially important.

The technique employed herein attempts to balance ergonomics with adjustment.
Authorial control is key, and this is lost when an author is faced with a
jet cockpit level of controls that ultimately fail to affect the territory
in question. The foolish would model the universe in an attempt to emulate
creative chemical film, only to discover that a well designed matrix will
exceed the performance of the Universe Emulator, with a much higher probability
of fewer cognitive errors.

Any attempt to harness the ideas within this archive should expose these
rotation and inset parameters. If one does not understand why, one would do
well to try and understand how they interact with the channel by channel 
mechanisms.

# On "Gamut Mapping"

Small minds concern themselves with such a term. Wise minds ask themselves
what the goal is. If the goal seems self-explanatory to a mind, it is with
certainty we can claim that such a mind has not contemplated the topic.

This is not to say that the issue of out of domain stimuli is not an issue,
but rather that there are no answers, yet. Feel free to attempt to employ
the bogus nonsense some groups have tried. These approaches do not work in
any way, shape, or form.

For the wise among you looking for a reasonable entry point, look to the
neurophysiological gradients, and how they may rest at the feet of cognitive
Cartesian-like constructions in our minds.

Feel free to read the worthless book entitled as such, but no answers rest
in colourimetry nor any other practitioner of charlatanism.

In light of the above, it is worthwhile for folks to experiment with the
handling of out of domain stimuli and the relationships to our cognition of
projected Cartesian-like frames. Do not succumb to number fornications, and
always put cognition first, not the janky mumbo jumbo of the foolish number
fornicators.

# Future Spelunkers

Hopefully there are enough breadcrumbs here for the quiet lurker to get
off of the ground reasonably well. There are vastly better ideas than those
in this repository, but you have not crafted them yet.
